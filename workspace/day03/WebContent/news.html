					Actor Jin Seon-kyu took the role he was offered for comedy 
					film “Count” immediately after reading the scenario because the character was just like himself, 
					according to Jin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					“When I first read the scenario four years ago, not only was the story fun, but many parts of Si-heon were similar to myself, " the actor told reporters during a press conference held at CGV Yongsan,
					 in Seoul, Monday.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In “Count,” Jin plays Si-heon, a former boxing Olympic medalist who now teaches students at a high school in Jinhae, North Gyeongsang Province.
					 Si-heon, a stubborn and sometimes annoying physical education teacher, decides to form a boxing team after discovering talent in his student Yoon-woo,
					  played by Sung Yoo-bin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The actor was also born in the port city and he had dreamed of becoming a PE teacher before he took up acting.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					“I even asked director Kwon Hyuk-jae not to show the scenario to anyone else,
					 because I believed that Si-heon was me and I was Si-heon,” he said, 
					adding that boxing has been one of his all-time favorite sports.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The film is Jin’s first movie in which he plays a lead role.
					 He has played important supporting roles in various hit films such as “The Outlaws” (2017) and “Extreme Job” (2018).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					“I had a lot of worries as a lead character because I was the one to lead the overall plot in the film and also,
					 I had to show good acting,” said Jin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					“But it was my fellow actors who supported me and made me feel less pressure 
					(about having to play the first-ever lead role),” he added.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In “Count,” Jin is joined by his close actor friends of 20 years -- 
					Oh Na-ra who plays Si-heon’s nagging wife and Go Chang-seok who plays the school’s principal.
